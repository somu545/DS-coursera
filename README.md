# IBM-DS-Capstone: SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

This repository contains the files and projects for the capstone project of the Data Science Professional Certificate provided by IBM on Coursera. The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning pipeline to predict the success of landing the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket.

## Week 1

### Data Collection API Lab
- `dataset_part_1.csv`: Contains the data collected from the SpaceX API.
- `jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook detailing the data collection process from the SpaceX API.

### Data Collection with Web Scraping Lab
- `jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook illustrating how to scrape web data about SpaceX launches.
- `spacex_web_scraped.csv`: Contains the data scraped from SpaceX launch records on Wikipedia.

### Data Wrangling
- `labs-jupyter-spacex-Data wrangling.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating data cleaning and transformation techniques.

## Week 2

### EDA with Visualization Lab
- `dataset_part_3.csv`: Dataset used for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- `jupyter-labs-eda-dataviz.ipynb.jupyterlite.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook showcasing various visualization techniques to uncover patterns in the data.

### EDA with SQL
- `Spacex.csv`: Dataset containing information about SpaceX launches used for SQL queries.
- `jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook performing exploratory data analysis using SQL queries.
- `my_data1.db`: SQLite database file containing the SpaceX data for use in SQL EDA.

## Week 3

### Interactive Dashboard with Plotly Dash
- `spacex_dash_app.py`: Python code for a Plotly Dash application that creates an interactive dashboard.
- `spacex_launch_dash.csv`: Data file used by the Plotly Dash application to display launch information.

### Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium Lab
- `Build_a_Dashboard_Application_with_Plotly_Dash.pdf`: PDF document explaining the process of building a dashboard application with Plotly Dash.
- `lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.jupyterlite.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of Folium for geospatial data visualization.

## Week 4

### Machine Learning Prediction Lab
- `SpaceX_Machine_Learning_Prediction_Part_5.jupyterlite.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the machine learning pipeline developed to predict the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings.

## Additional Resources

- `ds-capstone-template-coursera.pptx`: PowerPoint presentation file for the capstone project.
- `ds-capstone-template-coursera.pdf`: Exported PDF file from the PowerPoint file above.

## Project Overview

The project is structured around the following key tasks:

- Collecting data using the SpaceX API and web scraping.
- Wrangling the collected data into a suitable format for analysis.
- Exploring and visualizing the data to identify patterns and insights.
- Building interactive visual analytics with Folium and creating a dashboard using Plotly Dash.
- Developing and evaluating machine learning models to predict successful Falcon 9 first stage landings.

## Conclusion

The analysis and predictive modeling performed in this project aim to enhance decision-making for SpaceX and other companies in the space industry. By predicting the successful landings of rocket first stages, we can estimate the cost of launches more accurately and improve the economic feasibility of space missions.
